# CMake is required to compile software (http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html)
#
# You can install software by executing this file: sh INSTALL
#
# Prepare directories:
rm -rf build
mkdir  build

# Go in the 'build' directory
cd build

# Prepare the makefile
cmake ..

# Run the newly created makefile:
make -j8

# Go back at the installation root directory
cd ..
